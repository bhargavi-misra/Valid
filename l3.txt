PROGRAM -2: 
Aim: To understand and use various network utility commands such as PING, NETSTAT, 
IPCONFIG, IFCONFIG, ARP, TRACE-ROUTE, NSLOOKUP, and PATHPING to monitor and 
troubleshoot network configurations. 
Theoretical Description: 
Network utility commands are used to perform a variety of network-related operations. These 
commands allow users to check network status, troubleshoot issues, and gather information about 
devices and network routes. Here’s a brief description of each command: 

 PING: Sends ICMP echo requests to a target IP address or hostname to verify connectivity. 
NETSTAT: Displays active connections, listening ports, routing tables, and network statistics. 
IPCONFIG (Windows) / IFCONFIG (Linux): Shows the IP configuration of network interfaces. 
ARP: Displays the ARP table (mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses) used in a network. 
TRACE-ROUTE: Traces the route that packets take to reach a destination, displaying each hop. 
NSLOOKUP: Queries DNS servers for IP addresses corresponding to domain names. 
PATHPING: Combines PING and TRACE-ROUTE functionalities, showing packet loss and 
latency over each hop. 
Algorithm: For each command, the algorithm generally follows this pattern: 
1. Open a Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux). 
2. Run the command with necessary parameters (e.g., IP address, hostname). 
3. Observe the output for insights into network status or issues. 
4. Interpret the results based on what the command outputs (e.g., latency for PING, route for TRACE- 
ROUTE).

Conclusion: In this experiment, we explored different network utility commands that allow us to 
check network configurations, trace routes, and troubleshoot network issues. Each command serves 
a specific purpose, ranging from checking basic connectivity (PING) to analyzing network traffic 
(NETSTAT) and route discovery (TRACE-ROUTE, PATHPING). These tools are vital for network 
administrators to ensure proper network functionality and identify potential issues. 
Viva Questions: 
1. What is the function of the PING command? 
2. Explain the difference between IPCONFIG and IFCONFIG. 
3. How does the TRACE-ROUTE command help in identifying network issues? 
4. What does the NSLOOKUP command do?
