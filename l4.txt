Aim: To configure Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on a network device (such as a 
router) to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices connected to the network and verify the correct 
configuration. 
Theoretical Description: 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to dynamically 
assign IP addresses and other related network configuration information (like subnet mask, gateway, 
DNS) to devices in a network. This eliminates the need for manually configuring each device with an IP 
address. 
A DHCP server assigns IP addresses from a predefined range or pool of IP addresses to devices 
(clients) requesting an address. This system ensures efficient and automated distribution of IP 
addresses, reducing the risk of IP conflicts. 
The basic process of DHCP includes four steps:

client. 
DHCP Discover: The client broadcasts a request to find a DHCP server. 
DHCP Offer: The server responds with an IP address offer. 
DHCP Request: The client requests the offered IP address. 
DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK): The server confirms and assigns the IP address to the 
Algorithm: 
1. Network Setup: 
a. In Packet Tracer (or physical setup), place a router (or DHCP server), a switch, and 
several end devices (PCs, laptops). 
b. Connect the router to the switch, and connect the end devices to the switch using 
straight-through cables. 
2. DHCP Configuration on the Router: 
a. Access the router's CLI. 
b. Enter global configuration mode and configure a DHCP pool with a range of IP 
addresses.

3. Exclude Specific IP Addresses (Optional): 
a. If certain IPs (like the router itself) should not be assigned dynamically 
4. IP Configuration on End Devices: 
a. On the PCs connected to the network, go to the Desktop tab in Packet Tracer, open IP 
Configuration, and select DHCP. 
b. The PCs should automatically obtain an IP address from the DHCP server. 
5. Verification: 
a. On the router, use the following command to verify the leased IP addresses: 
i. Router# show ip dhcp binding 
Output: 
1. PC IP Configuration (Automatically Assigned): 
a. IP Address: 192.168.1.11 
b. Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 
c. Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 
d. DNS Server: 8.8.8.8 
2. DHCP Binding Output (On Router): 
a. IP address 
Client-ID/Lease expiration Type 
b. 192.168.1.11 0001.4a55.a3b7 
c. 192.168.1.12 0002.4b67.fad9 
3. DHCP Show Command Output: 
a. Router# show ip dhcp binding 
b. Router# show ip dhcp pool 
c. Pool MY_POOL : 
Automatic

d. Utilization: 2 addresses in use, 246 available 
e. Subnet size: 256 
Conclusion: In conclusion, DHCP is a technology that simplifies network setup by 
automatically assigning IP addresses and network configurations to devices. While DHCP offers 
convenience, it’s important to manage its security carefully. Issues such as IP address 
exhaustion, and potential data access through DNS settings highlight the need for robust security 
measures like firewalls and VPNs to protect networks from unauthorized access and disruptions. 
DHCP remains essential for efficiently managing network connections while ensuring security 
against potential risks. 
Viva Questions: 
1. What is the role of a DHCP server in a network? 
2. Explain the DHCP Discover and DHCP Offer processes. 
3. What is the significance of the default-router command in DHCP configuration? 
4. Why would you use the ip dhcp excluded-address command in DHCP 
configuration?
