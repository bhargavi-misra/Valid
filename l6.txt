Aim: To configure Static Routing on a network using routers, ensuring data packets are directed to 
the correct destination networks via predefined paths. 
Theoretical Description: Static routing is a routing technique in which a network administrator 
manually adds routes to a routing table. Unlike dynamic routing protocols, static routing does 
not adjust automatically to network topology changes. It is commonly used in small, simple 
networks or where specific routes need to be enforced due to security or performance 
requirements.

Network Setup: 
o
 Design the network topology with at least two routers, connected via serial or 
Ethernet links, along with some end devices (PCs or switches) connected to each router. 
Access Each Router's CLI: 
o
 Open the terminal on each router and switch to Privileged EXEC Mode using the 
enable command. 
Assign IP Addresses to Router Interfaces: 
o
 Configure IP addresses for the router interfaces that connect to each other and to 
the local networks. 
Define Static Routes: 
o
 For each network, define the next-hop router IP address (or exit interface) for 
routing traffic. 
Test Connectivity: 
o
 Use the ping and traceroute commands to verify that the devices in different 
networks can communicate.

Conclusion: In this experiment, we successfully configured Static Routing between two routers. 
By defining static routes, we manually instructed each router on how to reach the other network. 
This allowed communication between devices in different networks.
