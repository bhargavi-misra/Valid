Aim: To configure VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) on a switch and verify its functionality by 
assigning ports to different VLANs. Additionally, troubleshoot VLAN-related issues to ensure proper 
network segmentation. 
Theoretical Description: VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical grouping of devices 
within a network that allows segmentation of a network into different broadcast domains. This 
segmentation enhances security, improves network performance, and simplifies network 
management by grouping devices logically instead of physically. 
A VLAN operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model, and each VLAN acts as a 
separate network segment, even if the devices are connected to the same physical switch. Devices in 
the same VLAN can communicate with each other, while devices in different VLANs require a 
Layer 3 device (like a router) to communicate. 
Common VLAN types:

 Default VLAN: All switch ports belong to VLAN 1 by default. 
Data VLAN: Carries user-generated traffic (e.g., VLAN 10 for HR, VLAN 20 for Sales). 
Voice VLAN: Carries voice traffic, typically prioritized over data traffic. 
Management VLAN: Used for network management traffic (e.g., SSH, Telnet). 
Algorithm: 
1. Define Network Topology: 
a. Identify the switch and end devices (PCs) that need to be assigned to different VLANs. 
2. Access Switch: 
a. Log into the switch and enter global configuration mode. 
3. Create VLANs: 
a. Create and name VLANs as per the network requirements. 
4. Assign Ports to VLANs: 
a. Assign specific switch ports to the desired VLANs.

5. Configure Trunk Ports (Optional): 
a. If multiple switches are connected, configure trunking on the switch-to-switch link to 
allow traffic from multiple VLANs to pass through. 
6. Verify VLAN Configuration: 
a. Verify VLANs and ensure devices within the same VLAN can communicate. 
7. Troubleshoot VLAN Issues: 
a. Check the VLAN configuration for any misconfigured ports or VLAN assignments. 
Output: 
Conclusion: In this experiment, we successfully configured VLANs on a switch, segmented the 
network into different broadcast domains, and tested communication between devices within the 
same VLAN. We also learned to troubleshoot common VLAN issues such as misconfigured 
ports and trunk links.
