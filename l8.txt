Aim: To configure Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol on multiple routers in a 
network and troubleshoot common OSPF configuration issues. 
Theoretical Description: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol used 
in Internet Protocol (IP) networks to find the best path for data to travel. OSPF is more efficient 
and scalable compared to distance-vector routing protocols like RIP. It is widely used in both 
small and large enterprise networks and is part of the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) suite. 
Algorithm: 
1. Define Network Topology: 
a. Create a network with at least two routers connected via serial or Ethernet links. Each 
router should be connected to end devices like PCs or switches. 
2. Configure IP Addresses: 
a. Assign IP addresses to all router interfaces connecting them to each other and to local 
networks. 
3. Enable OSPF: 
a. On each router, enable OSPF, assign a process ID, and specify the OSPF area (typically 
Area 0). 
4. Advertise Networks: 
a. Use the network command to define the networks that OSPF will advertise to other 
routers. 
5. Verify and Troubleshoot: 
a. Check OSPF neighbors, routing tables, and troubleshoot any connectivity issues.

Conclusion: In this experiment, we successfully configured OSPF on multiple routers and 
dynamically propagated routes between them. OSPF's link-state nature ensures fast convergence 
and efficient path selection based on the cost metric. Additionally, we troubleshooted common 
OSPF configuration errors, such as incorrect network statements, mismatched OSPF timers, and 
neighbor adjacency issues.
