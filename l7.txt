Aim: To configure Routing Information Protocol (RIP) on a set of routers to enable dynamic routing 
between multiple networks. 
Theoretical Description: Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol 
used in local and wide area networks. RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop 
count as the metric for path selection. RIP has two versions, RIPv1 and RIPv2, with some key 
differences: 

 
 RIPv1: A classful routing protocol that does not support subnet information and works without 
sending subnet masks, making it unsuitable for Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) or 
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). 
RIPv2: A classless routing protocol that supports subnet masks and includes VLSM and CIDR 
support. RIPv2 also supports authentication and multicast for route updates. 
Algorithm: 
1. Setup Network Topology: 
o
 Design a network with at least two or more routers connected via serial or Ethernet 
links. Configure IP addresses on each router’s interface. 
2. Enter Global Configuration Mode: 
o
 On each router, access the command-line interface (CLI) and switch to privileged 
EXEC mode. 
3. Enable RIP: 
o
 Enable RIP on each router and specify the version (RIPv1 or RIPv2). 
4. Advertise Networks: 
o
 For each router, advertise the connected networks so RIP can propagate the routes 
dynamically. 
5. Verify Configuration: 
o
 Output: 
Check that the routers have dynamically learned the routes from other routers using 
the RIP protocol.

Conclusion: In this experiment, we configured both RIPv1 and RIPv2. RIPv1 does not support 
subnetting, which limits its usefulness in modern networks. RIPv2, however, is classless and 
supports VLSM and CIDR, making it more flexible. By configuring RIP, we were able to 
dynamically propagate routes between routers and verify communication between different 
networks.
