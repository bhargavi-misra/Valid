Aim: To implement and analyze the Network Address Translation (NAT) protocol in a simulated 
network environment to understand its configuration, operation, and troubleshooting techniques. 
Theoretical Description: Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used in 
networking to translate private (non-routable) IP addresses to a public (routable) IP address and 
vice versa. NAT is crucial for conserving the limited number of public IP addresses and 
enhancing security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks. 
Types of NAT: 
1. Static NAT: A fixed mapping between a private IP and a public IP, allowing external devices 
to access internal servers. 
2. Dynamic NAT: Maps private IPs to a public IP from a defined pool. 
3. PAT (Port Address Translation): Allows multiple devices on a local network to be mapped 
to a single public IP address, differentiated by unique port numbers. 
Key Concepts: 

 
 
 NAT Inside: Refers to the internal network. 
NAT Outside: Refers to the external network (internet). 
Translation Table: Maintains the mapping between private and public IP addresses. 
Algorithm: 
1. Define Access List: 
a. Create an access list to identify internal IPs that should be translated. 
2. Configure NAT Pool (for Dynamic NAT): 
a. Define a pool of public IP addresses for translation. 
3. Specify Interfaces: 
a. Configure the router interfaces as NAT inside or outside. 
4. Associate Access List with NAT Configuration: 
a. Link the access list to the NAT pool or define overload for PAT.

5. Test Connectivity: 
a. Check if devices can access external networks and whether NAT translations are 
happening. 
6. Troubleshoot if Necessary: 
a. Use commands to check NAT translations and statistics to diagnose issues. 
Output: 


 
 Successful translation of private IP addresses to a public IP address.

Conclusion: 
The implementation of NAT demonstrates its critical role in modern networking by enabling 
multiple devices to share a single public IP address while providing security by masking internal 
IP addresses. Understanding NAT configuration and troubleshooting enhances network 
management skills, ensuring efficient operation and connectivity in various network scenarios.
